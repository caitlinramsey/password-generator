# Password Generator

For this project, we were given starter code. Our task was to add code which would give the user the ability to generate a random secure password. We were tasked with giving the option of the length of the password wanted, which needed to be between 8 and 128 characters. We also needed to have the option to confirm or deny whether they wanted uppercase, lowercase, special, and/or numeric characters in their password. Based on the responses given, we needed to write code that would pick random characters out of the selected criteria and return a password that contained the chosen characters and length.

Below is a screenshot of what the application looks like:
